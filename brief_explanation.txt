I chose to send coordinate (x, y), motor speed, and IR values to simulate robotics-related information.
The IR values contribute to the system by indicating whether or not the system is on path. 
If the car is off the line, the sensor will read a different value than if it were on the line. 
This information can be used to make other decisions such as where to steer.
The coordinate values contribute by indicating the current location of the system. 
This information could be used to map out the history and current location.
The motor speed contributes by controlling the actual system. 
The publisher node utilizes a left and right motor which stees the system by increaseing/decreasing the values of either motor.
When combined together, these types of data would allow a car to self navigate and steer on a 'black line'
